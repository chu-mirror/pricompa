# Pricompa (priconne companion)

Use WSL and a tool [mweb](www.github.com/chu-mirror/mweb) to compile,
beside this, set environment variable PATH in windows to contain "VsDevCmd",
which usually come togother with your Visual Studio(_2022/BuildTools/Common7/Tools_
in my computer).

```
$ make build
```
