Short cuts:

+ CTRL-A: auto clicker
+ CTRL-S: auto clicker in slacc mode
+ CTRL-Q: quit

The two auto clickers share same key bindings.

+ ASDFG: from left to right, UB1-UB5
+ space: change speed
+ C: ON/OFF auto
+ B: pause
+ Q: quit auto clicker

When using auto clicker, you press the UB's corresponding key for a while
to do auto clicking.  It has a high frequency but does not support auto clicking
multiple UBs simultaneously.

Auto clicker in slacc mode uses a different strategy, you press the corresponding key
to turn on/off UBs.
